					<description><![CDATA[How is the DNB used in operational NWP? How useful it is? Has its impact on prediction accuracy been quantified?

How is the DNB used for climate studies?

Why was it not  implemented in the GEO imagers?

Thanks]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very interesting post!
Do you suggest any method (or tool) to remove Lunar Radiance from DNB images? 
Where can I ask for support concerning lunar radiance removal?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very interesting... I had not heard about this until now. It makes sense how the dust would cause faster snow melt. It makes you wonder how much this has added to the wildfire situation in the High Plains this season.]]></description>

You got it!

en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_saury. 

As Wiki say, these fish congregate in autumn in the middle of the Pacific and fishing boat use 500W light to attract saury. White on one side and red light on the other. Because of the &quot;..great economic importance..&quot; it explain the density of ships/lights. The green light would be the big freezer ship at the periphery of the pack.]]></description>
