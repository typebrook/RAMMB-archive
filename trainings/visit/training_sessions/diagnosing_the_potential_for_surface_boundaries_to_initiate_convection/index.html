<h2>Introduction</h2>
<hr />
<p>While IC9.2.1 covered integrated sensor applications to analyzing surface boundary locations, this session goes one step forward to analyzing the characteristics of surface boundaries that are currently understood to be related to initiating convection. This session will address the questions that are asked below:</p>
<ul>
<li>How representative are objective analysis of surface convergence to that of real convergence across boundaries?</li>
<li>How can a forecaster make estimations on the depth of a boundary ascent zone?</li>
<li>What boundary-relative flow and shear configurations are favorable (not favorable) for initiating convection?How can boundary-relative flow and shear be easily calculated using AWIPS?</li>
<li>What impact to boundary intersections and undulations have on the probability of convective initiation?</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the scope of this session is limited to surface-based convective initiation on low-level boundaries. This is only a small part of the large number of considerations regarding convective initiation forecasting.</p>
<p>Also remember that the considerations that we present in this session are not hard proven answers that will be the sole basis for anticipating convective initiation. Much research still needs to be done in this area. Some of the theories presented here may change given new observational and theoretical evidence. A major field program called TIMEx is planned in 2002 in the Great Plains in order to understand the nature of convective initiation. In the meantime, each of you also have the capability to validate how effective some of these theories are for your area.</p>
<h3>Objectives:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Using AWIPS tools, be able to objectively analyze and assess the most relevant boundary characteristics which are presently considered influential in initiating deep moist convection.</li>
<li>Through the process of 1) above, incorporate successful forecasts of convection initiation in the short-term forecast/nowcast (NOW).</li>

<td>Objectives</td>
<td><a name="slide2"></a> <b>1. To diagnose boundary characteristics considered relevant to initiating deep convection.</b><br />
For the first goal, there are many boundary characteristics you should be able to determine starting with the available CAPE and CIN of the environment, strength of the low-level convergence, depth of the boundary, environmental shear and boundary-relative flow, and along-boundary variations like intersections.</p>
<p><b>2. Improve short term forecasts of convective initiation.</b><br />
At the end of this session, you should be aware of the most recent theoretical work on boundary characteristics that modulate the initiation of convection. You should also be aware of several techniques that you can perform using AWIPS to apply these theories to short term forecasting of thunderstorms.</p>

<td>Scope of this session</td>
<td><a name="slide3"></a> <b>1. Convective initiation refers to deep, moist convection.</b><br />
The definition here of deep moist convection is that which produces precipitation. Any cumulonimbus cloud applies in this case.</p>
<p><b>2. Limited to initiation directly resulting from surface boundaries.</b><br />
We exclude mentioning initiation resulting from elevated convection caused by warm air ascending well behind a boundary such as a warm front. Surface-based convection forms from direct parcel ascent from near the surface (within 100&#8217;s of meters AGL). However, we consider only the surface-based convection that forms within 50 km or 40 minutes of an identifiable boundary rooted in the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL).</p>
<p><b>3. Initiation mechanisms are considerations, not hard fact.</b><br />
Convective initiation is one of the least observed and least understood phenomena in meteorology. What is presented to you in this session are the currently understood theories and considerations on what boundary characteristics are important in convective initiation. In the next couple years, the theories presented here may change significantly based on new modeling and observational studies. There is a planned field project called TIMEX (Thunderstorm Initiation Mobile Experiment) in 2002 that will sample boundaries with unprecedented detail. We should learn more from this one experiment than we know about convective initiation to date.</p>

<td>CAPE/CIN</td>
<td><a name="slide5"></a> <b>Positive CAPE is a necessary but not sufficient condition for convective initiation. Environmental CIN is also not a sufficient condition for initiation. Therein lies the problem.</b></p>
<p>Take a look at sounding or model based CIN fields in the warm season and you will see vast areas of zero CIN and positive CAPE with no thunderstorms present. Clearly removing CIN is not a sufficient condition to initiate convection.</p>
<p><b>Considerations: </b></p>
<p><b> • Strong mesoscale updrafts can force air through large CIN. However, initiation not likely in zero CIN unless there is some forced updraft.</b><br />
What is meant by forced updraft is a mesoscale region of ascending air that helps provide a support base for subsequent parcels to reach the LFC. This mesoscale updraft can arise from free atmospheric convective cells such as rolls, rayleigh convection. Mostly, boundaries, topography create the mesoscale ascent.</p>
<p>•<b> Initial cumulus and TCU rarely follow the theoretical surface-based moist adiabat.</b><br />
This will be shown in frame 7 where we examine where entrainment forces the parcel thermodynamics to deviate from the theoretical curve.</p>
<p><b>• Virtual temperature corrections have an uncertain impact on CAPE/CIN. The next slide shows an example of this.</b></p>

<td>CAPE/CIN: Schematic of a boundary</td>
<td><a name="slide6"></a> <b>• Updraft from density gradient and/or low-level convergence, CL can double MLCAPE (Mixed Layer CAPE) and locally reduce CIN to zero.</b></p>
<p><b> </b> This is not surprising since Mixed Layer CAPE uses a layer and moisture needs to be well mixed . What maybe surprising and a bit sobering is that MLCAPE can double or more depending on whether the sounding was launched inside out outside of a boundary. Even Horizontal Convective Rolls (HCRs) can lead to the same differences in CAPE. Evening soundings half a roughly 50/50 chance of being launched inside or outside an HCR updraft zone.</p>

<td>LFC Considerations</td>
<td><a name="slide7"></a> <b>Assume a 1.5 km deep outflow boundary pushing air upward</b></p>
<p><b>Surface air will be displaced upward at least 1.5 km</b></p>
<p><b>Air at higher initial levels also is forced upward but with less total displacement. </b></p>
<p><b>Convection is likely if an airparcel at some level is lifted to the LFC corresponding to that parcel.</b></p>
<p>Imagine air flowing over a solid obstacle such as a mountain range or, in this case, a sharp outflow boundary. Air trajectories would likely follow the paths outlined in this figure. The lowest level air would be forced upward the most. However, as the initial parcel level increases, the forced vertical displacement diminishes. This kind of lifting profile is a rough estimation of reality derived from laboratory observations by Simpson (1969) (QJR. Meteorl Soc., 104, pp 413)and radar observations by Wakimoto (1982)(MWR, 110, pp 1060)</p>
<p>The flow patterns may not match what is shown here but the vertical displacements relative to the LFC can be illustrated here. The LFC changes according to the sounding and the level of the parcel origin. In this diagram, the parcel lifted along the yellow trajectory successfully reaches its LFC to initiate deep convection.</p>
<p>Foote (1984) used the theoretical lifting profile of air forced upward by a gustfront to the vertical profile of lifting distance needed to air parcels at various levels to reach their respective LFCs. The application, which will be shown in the next few frames, shows which vertical moisture profiles are favorable for boundaries to initiate convection.</p>

<td>LFC: GOES vis loop centered at KEDW</td>

During this loop, KEDW remained on the western edge of the most active convection except for the one small thunderstorm that passed overhead.</p>
<p><b>As an aside</b>&#8230;.The first frame of the loop shows the ceiling heights at about 6500 ft AGL which, if is the base of cumulus clouds and the boundary layer was well mixed, would yield a dewpoint depression of 30° F. The actual dewpoint depression was 37° F.</p>

<td><a name="slide9"></a> <b>• Would convection form with a 1.5 km deep outflow boundary? Given an outflow boundary plowing into the airmass represented by this sounding, could deep convection form? </b></p>
<p><b> • Consider the amount of lifting required to bring an air parcel from its initial height to its LFC called H<sub>lfc-z</sub>.</b> For example, a surface air parcel would need to be lifted 2.1 km. Therefore, H<sub>lfc-z</sub> = 2.1. <b> </b></p>
<p><b> • Then consider a vertical profile H<sub>lfc-z</sub> and compare it to a theoretical vertical profile of vertical air displacements by Foote, 1984.</b></p>

<p><b> • Favorable convective soundings occur where:<br />
• LFC heights are low<br />
• Boundary depth is deep relative to the Hlfc-z profile.</b></p>

<p><b> • Does not apply to non-density current boundaries.</b></p>
<p>This is a rather old theoretical treatment of lifting over a density current boundary. Air parcel trajectories may differ greatly and in fact we&#8217;ll see that shear and mean flow profiles relative to boundary motion can impact the depth of the ascending zone. Non density current boundaries will likely have a completely different set of air trajectories within the ascending zone.</p>

<p><b>• The fineline partially fills the beam between points A and B.</b></p>

<p><b>• Once the beam top exits the top of the boundary, reflectivity decreases at point A.</b></p>
<p>The beam top starts exiting the top of the boundary fineline and the returned reflectivity decreases more rapidly as the percentage of target coverage drops. Knowing the height of the beam top is more crucial than knowing the beam center height. One does not know where in that beam volume the fineline top is located.</p>
<p><b>• Therefore, use the beam top elevation to estimate the depth of a boundary. </b></p>
<p>Therefore the best method for detecting the top of a linear feature like a fineline is knowing how high the beam top is when the reflectivity starts to fall. For that reason, we have developed an applet for the web that is located on the front web page for this session.</p>

<td>Depth of a Boundary Ascent Zone: 88D Base Velocity Considerations</td>
<td><a name="slide18"></a> <b>• Typically, air should be ascending above the maximum height convergence is found.</b></p>
<p>Unlike reflectivity where you seeing direct evidence of ascending air manifesting as finelines. Here, you are only observing convergence/divergence. Calculating the integrated values of convergence below and up to the level of the radar beam is the only real way of knowing the sign of the vertical velocity. If you see convergence in the velocity display, most likely there is ascent occurring at that level. In a classic frontal-like circulation, the level of non-divergence is where the maximum ascent occurs. Therefore, ascending air should exceed the height of any convergence you see.</p>
<p><b>• However, detecting convergence is difficult due to the large default velocity increments of ± 10 kts.</b></p>
<p>Most weakly forced boundaries exhibit less than 20kts of cross-boundary wind differential. The current velocity increments would never adequately capture most boundaries, especially when the wind directions are mostly tangential.</p>
<p><b>• Solution, when possible reduce the velocity increments in the low range at the UCP.</b></p>
<p>Look in the Selection of product parameters menu in the UCP then pull of the velocity submenu. You can reduce the increment levels in there when you&#8217;re experiencing difficulty in discerning boundaries. Don&#8217;t forget to change it back when severe storms start forming.</p>

<td><a name="slide19"></a> <b>• Velocity gradients may also be entirely tangential leading to poor detection as seen in this image at pt. C.</b></p>
<p>A boundary passing over a radar maybe completely invisible in the base velocity if the winds on both sides of the boundary are tangential. Try to draw various windfields that might not show in a clear air base velocity display.</p>
<p><b>• However, velocity echoes display at lower threshold reflectivity.</b></p>
<p>The precipitation mode reflectivity displays do not show the lowest reflectivity that the radar observes. The base velocity shows velocity for all observable echoes. Therefore, you can observe boundaries on occasion out to greater ranges in the base velocity when the radar is in precipitation mode.</p>

<td>Depth of a Boundary Ascent Zone: Satellite Applications</td>
<td><a name="slide20"></a> <b>• An organized cumulus line implies that mesoscale ascent is reaching the LCL. </b></p>
<p>This is a simple but very useful benchmark for knowing when a boundary ascent zone reaches the LCL. For all the capabilities of radar, it simply cannot observe cumulus clouds. And it&#8217;s always a good idea to have cumulus to develop before a storm develops. The image on the right is a highly magnified view of a boundary in GOES-8 visible imagery. There are two east-west cumulus lines that indicate boundary lifting through the LCL.</p>
<p><b>• Organized TCU indicates deeper boundary lifting and more likely initiation.</b></p>
<p>This is not so easy to discern. There is no benchmark for observing when cumulus break through the LFC. Towering cumulus are also difficult to define from satellite data alone. One good candidate for a benchmark is the 3.9 micron reflectivity or albedo data during the day and the fog product or nocturnal 3.9 micron albedo product at night. These products (especially the daylight ones) are very sensitive to the onset of glaciation. In rapid scan imagery, the timing of glaciation in cumulus can be an important benchmark to anticipating storm development in a short term forecast.</p>
<p>• Moisture/temp gradients on low-level water vapor imagery indicates deep boundary.</p>
<p>This idea is uncertain. However, the deeper the air on the cool or dry side of a boundary, the more likely, the low-level water vapor sounder imagery will observe a temperature/moisture gradient.</p>

<td><a name="slide21"></a> There are two curious manifestations of outflow boundaries in this loop:</p>
<p>Boundary # 1 is just emerging from a group of thunderstorms as an arc of stratiform clouds. This is not surprising judging from the lack of cumulus in the air preceding this boundary. Although there isn&#8217;t enough information to make any claims about the stability of the boundary yet. In any case, the forced lifting is reaching the LCL of the environment, whatever depth that might be.</p>
<p>Boundary #2 is not easy to define. Upon looping the visible imagery, notice the cumulus clouds moving east and dissipating along a north to south line just south of the label. There is a boundary along that line of dissipation. Go on to the next two slides for an closer look.</p>

<td><a name="slide23"></a> The Base reflectivity image shows a strong fineline associated with the boundary #2. Recalling from Session 1, finelines with reflectivities &gt; 15dBZ likely arise from particulate scattering from insects or plant debris lofted vertically in an updraft. Therefore, ascending air is most likely up to a certain level along the boundary. Base Velocity supports the idea of ascent because of the strong convergence visible along the boundary. Ascending air reaches above the level of convergence. Ascending air is not likely, however, at the LCL of the western airmass since there is no enhancement of the cumulus in the GOES-8 VIS image.</p>

<td>The Depth of a Boundary Ascent Zone: Wind Profile considerations</td>
<td><a name="slide25"></a> In a time-height profile, the boundary motion vector needs to be known so that a time to space conversion can be done to convert the time from the boundary passage to distance from the boundary passage. For the VWP on the right, the surface boundary passed through around 1808 UTC. Given a boundary motion (estimated elsewhere) of 15kt from the north, each volumescan away from its passage represents about 1.5 nm further distant from the boundary. You can see the windshift is not immediate but rather more gradual with such a fine resolution wind profile as the VWP.</p>
<p><b>• The depth of the windshift might be related to the depth of the convergence.</b></p>
<p>This is a similar problem to that of the 88-D base velocity. Convergence can be estimated by the shift of the winds as the boundary passes. But to really calculate the vertical velocity profile, the convergence between two wind profiles on either side of the boundary needs to be calculated and then integrated. For visual inspection, the deeper the initial windshift, the more likely the convergence is deeper.</p>
<p>In the example on the right, the wind shifts immediately for the first two elevation gates (1 and 2 kft) above the radar in one volume scan. The 3kft gate wind remains unchanged for another 20 minutes (or 5nm behind the boundary). Finally, the 4kft wind (4th level) remains unchanged for 28 minutes before going to ‘No Data&#8217;. Most likely, the boundary interface has reached close to the 4kft range in 28 minutes.</p>
<p>It is difficult to say which wind profiles should be compared to get a picture of what the convergence is between the two sides of the boundary. In this case, say the width of the fineline is about 3nm. The wind profile at 1808 UTC would be inside the fineline. The 1803 profile sampled the air previous to the boundary. The 1813 profile could be close to the back edge of the fineline while the 1818 UTC should be clear of the back edge of the fineline. Assuming the winds directly in front of and behind the fineline are characteristic of the pre and post-boundary winds, and the convergence depth is equal to the depth of the windshift, then the convergence depth is between 2 and 3kft above radar level.</p>
<p><b>• The level of maximum ascent will likely be at the top of the convergence zone.</b></p>
<p><b>Cautions:</b></p>
<p><b>• Large VAD range will smooth out true wind gradients.</b></p>
<p>If the VAD range is very high, both sides of a boundary will be sam pled and a wind direction estimate will be attempted using data from disparate windfields. The default VAD range is 33km. A boundary moving at 20km/hr means there will be disparate wind fields for over an hour. If possible, bring in the VAD range as close as possible to the cone of silence at times of boundary passages.</p>
<p>The VAD range is the range out from the radar at which horizontal winds are calculated.</p>
<p><b>• Poor vertical resolution will allow for only .</b></p>
<p><b> • Horizontal variations in boundary depth not accounted.</b></p>
<p>Just like in the surface convergence estimations, wind profiles can only be used to estimate broad estimations of boundary depth convergence when you can safely ignore along-boundary variations in wind.</p>

<p>This illustrates the importance of being cognizant of how the VWP realistically depicts the environmental winds in regions of strong windshear.

<td>Low-level Convergence</td>
<td><a name="slide29"></a> Boundaries with the greatest persistent convergence would have the highest potential for initiating convection given all other parameters being equal. More details two sections later. The persistence helps account for how the boundary lies in relation to the surface observations. Often what may seem to be convergence could be a bad wind ob, or minor fluctuations in the reported winds. Persistence adds credibility that something is real there. <b>Cautions:<br />
• Most boundaries converge air on scales too small for even mesonetworks to resolve (Crook 1996). </b></p>
<p>The next several frames point this caution out in even more detail.</p>
<p><b>• Strength of convergence doesn&#8217;t always mean deep convergence. A boundary may have strong convergence down low and be capped well below the LFC.</b></p>
<p>This is a problem especially when the LFC is high and/or if there&#8217;s a significant capping layer below it. Drylines are notorious for exhibiting strong sfc convergence and yet shallow circulations.</p>
<p>One thing to remember is that when looking at the vertical continuity equation, the vertical velocity at some level depends on the integrated values of convergence/divergence below. Vertical velocity is highest at the level of non-divergence where convergence resides below and divergence above. In most cases, the deeper the convergence, the higher the level of maximum vertical velocity will become.</p>

<p>One could easily imagine a boundary as a two dimensional interface between two regions of differing winds. In this example, there are no irregularities in the wind field on either side of the boundary as one travels up or down the boundary.</p>
<p><b>• Then the only component of air doing the converging is that oriented perpendicular to the boundary (red vectors).</b></p>
<p><b>• In this case, convergence can be calculated by calculating differential velocity parallel to the baseline (yellow line). Which baseline distance?</b></p>
<p>Convergence doesn&#8217;t need to be calculated along X and Y cartesian coordinates. There is radial convergence and in this case, convergence calculated along a rotated coordinate system. The only axis the red vector winds are converging upon is the axis of the boundary. Therefore, the baseline that we calculate convergence is the only baseline down which the winds change which are the ones perpendicular to the axis of the boundary. You can almost think of convergence calculated in natural coordinates where n is the distance along the yellow baselines. Then dv/dn is the way to calculate convergence.</p>
<p>The problem is, over what length (n) do you calculate convergence? The best length is that where the winds change. The next frames show a typical boundary and typical convergences calculated using typical station spacings and a realistic convergence over the right baseline length.</p>

<td><a name="slide34"></a> <b>• The key is to figure out the width of the ascending air zone.</b></p>
<p>See the example on the right side. The width of the ascending air on this boundary is taken to be the width of the small cumulus line. Using the ‘Distance Bearing&#8217; function in D2D, the boundary width is about 4mi. There are a couple things to consider when attempting to estimate the width of the boundary</p>
<p><b>• The ascending zone maybe sloped causing an unrealistically large width of the boundary. </b></p>
<p><b>• The cumulus clouds mark the upper part of the ascending zone and may not be the same width as the region of convergence down near the surface. </b></p>
<p><b>• Then estimate the winds directly on either side of the ascent zone.</b></p>
<p>This is a challenge here because of the lack of stations. However, observing the wind tendencies at each station as the boundary passes is a possible space/time method of estimating the pre and post boundary winds. In this case, the pre-boundary winds were westerly at 7kts. The post-boundary winds were northerly 15kts.</p>
<p><b>• Finally take the difference in the wind component normal to the boundary divided by the width.</b></p>
<p>First, you need to know the boundary orientation. The long blue line from the ‘Distance Bearing&#8217; tool marks the rough orientation of the boundary. The line is oriented 100°. Therefore the line normal to the boundary is oriented from 010°. The component of the pre and post boundary winds should be taken along 010°. Then the difference of those components should be divided by the width of the boundary in meters.</p>

<td><a name="slide38"></a> <b>Many times, the actual depth of the mesoscale ascent cannot be measured. Fortunately, recent research results indicate there are observable factors that are related to the depth of a boundary ascent zone.</b></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a growing body of research including theoretical and observational that may promise in forecasting convective initiation on boundaries without having to directly observe the depth of a convergence zone or fineline. Simply knowing the properties of the windfield in the reference frame of the moving boundary may give some important considerations as to how deep a boundary ascent zone maybe which leads ultimately to the propensity for convective initiation.</p>
<p><b>Factors of influence on estimating the depth of a boundary ascent zone: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>Boundary-relative low-level flow.</li>
<li>Boundary-relative steering-layer flow</li>
<li>Boundary-orthogonal shear.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these topics will be considered in more detail in this section. There are addendums and quid pro quos in this section as with the last one. These concepts will not explicitly tell you where convection will form. Also, boundaries exhibiting unfavorable values of the above parameters can also initiate convection.

<td>Boundary-orthogonal steering layer flow</td>
<td><a name="slide39"></a> <b> The key is to maximize residence time of a parcel in the ascent zone to ensure it reaching the LFC. </b></p>
<p><b>Related to deep layer shear considerations but this applies to any boundary. </b></p>
<p>When a boundary does not have any density current characteristics, the shear considerations do not apply in the sense in which they were presented. In some sense shear is still important since boundary-normal shear can be too strong potentially ripping apart an ascending zone of air before it can reach the LFC.</p>
<p>However there is another way to look at the potential depth of an ascent zone. Given an ascending air column reaching toward the LFC, what kind of flow aloft will favor the ascending air column to remain over the boundary for the longest time? And what kind of flow aloft should be considered useful?</p>
<p><b>Observations by Wilson and Megenhardt, 1997. </b></p>
<ul>
<li>Boundaries in FL were most active if cell motion -boundary motion 5 m/s.</li>
<li>Before storms, the 2 &#8211; 4 km mean wind = cell motion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Several observational studies including this one sampled the mean flow in a 2- 4 km layer and found the boundaries were most convectively active when the boundary-normal flow was less than 5 m/s. The 2-4 km layer was chosen since it correlated best with new storm motion. Boundary-relative flows greater than 5 m/s exhibited less storm activity and those storms that did form on the boundary would quickly be left behind in less stable air and dissipate.</p>
<p>This study was done during a field project around Cape Kennedy during the summer. Therefore the storms were mostly driven by surface-based phenomenon and there were small amounts of shear. Whether these findings can apply to stronger synoptically forced situations still remains a question worthy of testing at any of your locations.</p>
<p>Note that not all storms will dissipate if the boundary-relative 2-4 km flow is high. Convection can persist or even thrive well after they leave the original boundary if there is still sufficient uncapped instability.</p>

<td>Shear considerations</td>
<td><a name="slide42"></a> <b>• These theories apply to density current boundaries.</b></p>
<p>Density current boundaries include strong fronts, seabreeze boundaries and outflow boundaries.</p>
<p><b>• Deepest ascent occurs when boundary orthogonal environmental shear balances cold pool vorticity (Rotunno et al. 1988) </b></p>
<p><b> • Or when the boundary speed (C) cancels out positive shear magnitude ( U<sub>L</sub>). C/ U<sub>L</sub> ~ 1.</b></p>
<p>When the boundary-normal (or orthogonal) component of the shear is oriented forward away from the cold side of the boundary (positive shear) and it has the same magnitude as the forward speed of the boundary, the conditions are optimal for the strongest, most vertically oriented ascent zone. That is C/ Delta U<sub>L</sub> ~ 1. This is graphically shown in the upper-left schematic.</p>
<p>What often occurs is shown in the lower right figure where the shear vector is directed front to rear of the boundary (negative shear). In that case, no balance occurs in C/ UL and the ascent zone becomes much shallower.</p>
<p>A question may arise, how can boundary speed C with units of m/s be compared with Delta U<sub>L</sub> with units of s<sup>-1</sup>? A possible answer lies in the assumed properties of a density current behind the leading edge. The strongest flow behind the boundary exists near the surface. The flow weakens with height until reaching near zero near the top edge. Actually there are numerous shearing eddies along the top edge of the cold pool. Then the velocity difference behind the boundary directed back from the leading edge with a magnitude equal to the forward speed of the boundary. Therefore, Rotunno et al. 1988 proposed that the forward motion of the boundary, C, can be used to compare to the magnitude of the shear (Delta U ) in the layer of air in front of the boundary.</p>
<p>Much has still yet to be understood regarding what shear layer should be used to anticipate convective initiation. None of these theories take into account the thermodynamic profile of the environmental air. Does the depth of the shear layer need to match some thermodynamically based parameter? Is one shear layer important for initiation considerations versus storm maintenance? Or is the shear argument relevant at all? Recent findings suggest there is no relationship between cold pool strength and low-level shear in the maintenance of long-lived severe squall lines. Refer to this work in review by Evans and Doswell, 00. There has not been enough observational evidence to support or refute the shear theories for convective initiation. However, each NWS office has the tools to evaluate whether boundary orthogonal shear is relevant.</p>

<td>Combining shear, steering layer flow and low-level boundary-relative flow theories</td>
<td><a name="slide43"></a> Here is a conceptual figure showing how likely an outflow boundary from a source thunderstorm will produce new convection for combinations of shear and low-level flow.</p>
<p>The depth of the leading edge of the outflow boundary (shaded in blue) corresponds to the depth of the ascending zone. The probabilities of new convection are proportional to the depth of the ascending zone in each scenario. There are no thermodynamic considerations in this schematic. The wind profile is given as a vertical profile of horizontal wind vectors pointing toward which the wind is blowing. The low-level flow is depicted by the lowest wind vector while the shear is visualized by the change in wind vectors with height. All the wind vectors are ground-relative. The depth of the shear layer depicted by the wind profile is about 4 km AGL. It is intended that the depth of the outflow is lower than the depth of the shear layer.</p>
<p>This figure is adapted from Moncrieff and Liu, 1999.</p>
<p>The second frame in this loop is a schematic considering the effects of mean layer flow on probabilities for initiation. In these considerations, the boundary depth itself is not known to be affected by shear. Instead the concern is the residence time for developing cumulus. Therefore, a boundary with strong headwinds, may not be able to produce deep convection because the steering layer flow prevents an upright deep ascending column.</p>

<p>The white line is actually a white arrow eminating from the boundary to the Storm motion point. The ground-relative cell motion is fairly quick but when taken relative to the boundary, the cell is just barely making it ahead of the boundary.</p>
<p><b>• Boundary-orthogonal shear (Delta U<sub>b 0-4km</sub>) is marked by the cyan line.</b></p>
<p>The boundary orthogonal shear vector is fairly strong and positive, a positive sign for initiation of convection. Note that the full shear vector was moved from its origin out to the boundary itself. Remember that shear is galilean invariant meaning that it is unaffected by any frame of reference. Also remember that the shear/cold pool theories only consider the boundary-orthogonal component of the shear vector.</p>

<p>Now we present a hypothetical circular boundary (like an outflow) conceptual figure where you have all possible boundary orientations. Just like on a hodograph, you may plot the mean wind or cell motion vector, the shear vector and the low-level wind vector.</p>
<p><b> • Determine V<sub>cell</sub> from mean flow or actual cell motion.</b></p>
<p>Vcell is the cell motion vector and in this case, it is from the west at 30 (any units).</p>
<p><b> • Determine which boundary motion will yield the smallest relative cell motion.</b></p>
<p>Here, boundary motion is defined similarly as with the hodograph situation. Take a direction from the origin out to the cyan circle, the intersection point is the boundary motion vector. Note the boundary motion vector that yields the smallest boundary-relative V<sub>cell</sub>. In this case, an eastward moving boundary of 20 (any units) yields the smallest value. The smallest V<sub>cell</sub> still exceeds the boundary speed by 10.</p>
<p><b> • Observe actual boundary motion and compare</b></p>
<p>If you have an actual boundary motion, you can plot the direction of motion on this hodograph. Then you can immediately compare the optimal boundary orientation to the actual boundary orientation and compare. If your boundary was moving out of the northeast, then your V<sub>cell</sub> would be -35, or rapidly front to rear of the boundary.</p>
<p>You can use this relation to calculate boundary-relative cell speed. U<sub>b</sub> = V<sub>cell</sub> cos(theta) -V<sub>front </sub> where U<sub>b </sub>= boundary-relative cell speed V<sub>cell</sub> = Cell motion or mean steering layer velocity. = angular difference between cell motion direction and boundary orientation. V<sub>front</sub> = Speed of the boundary.</p>

<p><b>To calculate boundary- orthogonal shear&#8230;</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Subtract the surface flow vector from a velocity vector 2 -4 km AGL from a hodograph or by using Product Maker on model analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p>This step is for estimating the shear vector of the environment on the most unstable side of a boundary. There is still a question of how deep a layer the shear should be calculated. This would be a good question a local study could answer. As a first application, we choose the 0-3km shear. At the lower end, you may wish to choose a representative wind in the lowest 100m.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use equation 2] to calculate the boundary orthogonal shear (S<sub>b</sub>).</li>
</ul>
<p>This equation, U<sub> b</sub> = V cos (theta) is similar to the one to calculate boundary-normal flow except for shear, boundary motion is irrelevant. The angle (theta) is still the angle between the direction from which the boundary is moving and the shear vector direction. What if the boundary is not moving? Then the angle for the boundary is taken here as the angle perpendicular to the boundary axis taken from the most stable to the least stable side.</p>
<p>For example, a stationary boundary oriented SW to NE with the most stable air located north of the boundary would have a boundary orientation of 315°. This is just a convention but it does help calculate the boundary-normal shear vector.</p>
<ul>
<li>See if V<sub>front</sub> / U<sub> b</sub> ~ 1 results in the most action.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the example on the right, a shear vector of 180 degrees at 10 kts is displayed as a red arrow at multiple points around the hypothetical circular outflow moving away from a point also at 10 kts. According the Rotunno et al. 1988, the optimal boundary motion vector would be one where the shear vector is pointed in a positive direction (away from the stable side) and the magnitude equals the boundary speed. In this example, an east-west boundary tangent to the top of the hypothetical circle moving north at 10 kts is the optimal boundary for initiating convection according to theory.</p>
<p>We have applied this hypothetical circular outflow boundary to calculate boundary-normal flow and shear to find out which boundary orientation would be most optimal for initiating convection. In the two past examples, the circular boundary was expanding outward at 10 units/time (e.g., m/s, kts). What happens with a slower or faster boundary speed? Well, for boundary-normal steering layer flow, equation 1 factors in the boundary speed and from that you may calculate the most optimal flow. For boundary-normal shear, only boundary orientation is important so that you may calculate the component of shear normal to the boundary. However when you are looking for the optimal condition where shear balances out boundary speed, V<sub>front</sub> / Delta U <sub>b</sub> ~ 1, then boundary speed comes into importance.</p>

Both observational studies focused on summer convection. However the Colorado Summer convection exists in environments with high LFC&#8217;s and LCL&#8217;s compared to that of North Carolina.

<p>For short term forecasting of convection (0-2 hr), there is no better way to monitor small spatial variations in atmospheric instability than by observing horizontal changes in the behavior of cumulus clouds by GOES satellite. Boundaries that lie or move into pre-existing fields of enhanced cumulus are very likely to initiate convection. Likewise, HCRs with enhanced cumulus are the ones to pay close attention to, especially if they intersect with boundaries. Again, boundaries with unfavorable values of boundary-normal shear and flow for initiating convection may do so prolifically if they interact with a pre-existing field of enhanced cumulus.</p>
<p>In fact, monitoring rapid changes in cumulus fields is a more important reason to invoke Rapid Scan Operations than waiting until there are mature severe storms.</p>

<p>For intersections, the convection may appear to lag the intersection point in cases where either or both boundaries are closing the gap before the intersection. Look for initiation about 15-30 minutes following the intersection for any one point.</p>
<p>For a boundary moving into a field of enhanced cumulus, look for these cumulus to initiate into storms between 10 and 40 minutes after boundary passage.</p>
<p>Collisions favor convective initiation at the point of collision about 15 to 30 minutes after the collision.</p>
<p>Stationary boundaries will tend to develop storms within 10km of their locations.</p>
<p>These rules of thumb were developed by Wilson and Schreiber, 1986 for typical summer convection. Given different CIN, LFC and instability, and strength of a boundary, these rules of thumb may change dramatically.</p>

<p>The MHX hodograph is somewhat different in that the low-level flow is westerly and the shear in the lowest one km is northerly.

<p>Estimating storm motion based on these hodographs is very problematic. The 0 &#8211; 6 km mean wind at MHX is 004° 2 m/s and at GSO, 164° 3 m/s. From 0 &#8211; H<sub>lfc</sub>(2km)the mean wind is easterly about 6 m/s. The wind remains easterly up to 3 km.

The station models in the surface overlay plot are slightly different. The virtual potential temperature is plotted in place of the surface pressure.</p>
<p>For the instructors in this exercise:<br />
1. have the participants analyze surface boundaries and areas of best instability (using different colors). Refer to the teletraining session for the actual exercise. This loop is here to help familiarize yourself with the case.</p>
