					<description><![CDATA[I was on the flight.  About 95% of the people on board had no noticeable injuries and sought no treatment.  As far as I know and saw, all of the people that were injured were not wearing a seat belt or had it too loose.

The plane had a downward acceleration for about 0.5 s.  From the way that things moved in the plane, my estimate is that the average acceleration of the plane was negative 3 g&#039;s for 0.5 s. If you&#039;re not wearing your seat belt, you get launched upwards at 2 g&#039;s relative to the plane.]]></description>
