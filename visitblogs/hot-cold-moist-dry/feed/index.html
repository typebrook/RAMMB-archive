					<description><![CDATA[To answer the question, one needs to know a few things:
1) There is a change of elevation from the S.E. Louisiana &#038;Texas Border (a few hundred feet above sea level) to the Texas/New Mexico border (about 5000 feet).
2) This is a nighttime GOES 10.7 micron infrared image (which actually spans the region 10.2 and 11.2 microns) which means that there is low level water vapor contamination in that channel.
3) You should have some basic knowledge about the synoptic situation, although it’s not necessary for answering these questions.

SO here we go, the prominent change from dark to light gray shades, i.e., the “prominent” feature that shows itself from central Kansas south through the western portion of Texas is most likely the “dry line.”   It is well defined because at nighttime the land cools at a slower rate in a moist atmosphere than a dry one.  If one looks at the daytime image you will see just the opposite (the moist region is cooler than the dry region because the dry ground heats up much faster than in the moist air).   So where is it more moist?  Likely at D and E where the height of the terrain is lower than at C so the moisture may be in greater depth at D and E; certainly A and B are much drier.  It’s hard to tell whether D or E is more moist.  It is here that a nighttime fog product might be helpful so that we could see if there was fog/stratus cloud cover at D and/or E; but even that might not be enough.  What is needed is an interferogram (high resolution look at the spectrum) in the 10-12 micron region at both locations (if clear): with that we would likely see important differences in boundary layer moisture throughout the image area, without it I don’t see how.  Indeed high spectral resolution sounder data would allow us to do some great diagnostics all throughout the image – maybe NESDIS will begin to supply such products or data from IASI (on Metop) and AIRS (on Aqua).

The surface temperature at night is likely warmer where the moisture is deeper (or where we have stratus (again the fog/stratus product).  An interesting thought is perhaps it’s warmer in the Palo Duro Canyon (the interesting dark area south of B and west of the bottom of C.  But that could be moisture in the canyon because it is lower elevation – do you think it’s moisture or the canyon effect (the walls radiate back and forth to each other rather than out to the clear skies like on a prairie).  If it’s moisture in the canyon due to its lower elevation, then at C the moisture is definitely less that D or E.

I think the prominent feature is a dry line rather than a front with dry air behind it because of the thunderstorm in Kansas.  I expect that the short wave over Colorado has brought the cold air from the North into the region from the tail of the thunderstorm to around point A and that the intersection where it meets the dry line is what helped generate the storm.  HOWVER, this should never be a guess as you should be familiar (which I am not in this case) with the synoptic situation, as well as wind, temperature, pressure and dew point changes.  If you were using the satellite imagery properly, it would have been to refine your mesoscale analysis of the situation and as a guide to thunderstorm development and evolution (as well as many many other things)]]></description>
