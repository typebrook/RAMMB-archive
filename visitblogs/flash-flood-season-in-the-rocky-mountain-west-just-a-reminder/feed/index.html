					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a native of Colorado and lived there for the Christmas Eve blizzard of 1982, moved to Cheyenne, Wyoming and lived there during the August 1985 flood and tornadoes, moved to Northern California and lived there during the October 1989 Earthquake.  (Now I live in Indiana and find myself terrified of tornadoes.)  Will your blog ever answer the question, &quot;Where in the US has a record of the fewest natural disasters?&quot;  I&#039;d love that!

The flood in Cheyenne was a terribly confusing night.  Unknown to us at the time, lightening had hit and the civil defense alarms didn&#039;t go off.  The first thing that made us start paying attention was the greenish hue to the sky.  We went outside to see 7 funnel clouds and ran back in to turn on the tv in the basement.  The reporters on the local tv station were rather unnerved and as people were still in their basements the rain came.  The switch from &quot;go to the lowest level to go to the highest level of your home&quot; was really a terrifying decision to make.  When the rain, the hail, the wind and the tornadoes stopped, we went back to our front porch to hear what sounded like a raging river in the dark.  Little did we know at that time that an 8 foot wall of water had come through &quot;dry creek&quot; only four houses away.  When we saw one of our neighbors in diving gear leave his home, we knew.  All the next day helicopters went up and down dry creek looking for people.  Over the next days the funeral processions wound down the road close to our house.  

It seems that everything that could go wrong went wrong in Cheyenne that night.  No warnings, no police or fire department services due to lightening and flooded computers, no phones.  When civil defense workers went and turned the sirens on by hand, they blared for an unusually long time.

I hope I never have to go through another night like that one.]]></description>
