					<description><![CDATA[Comment by Scott Bachmeier - CIMSS

Interesting images -- I have noticed that the sunrises and sunsets 
 here in Wisconsin the past 1-2 days  have been rather colorful (deep 
 reds and oranges), so I began to wonder  about an Asian source of 
 either smoke or dust (which happens quite often during Spring). For 
 those who question whether smoke can really be transported halfway 
 across the globe, I used the NOAA Air Resources Lab HYSPLIT model to 
 calculate 7-day backward trajectories from 3 points in the central US 
 (located approximately along the leading edge of the hazy plume seen 
 in the GOES-11 visible image): 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/4eqnlo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;http://tinyurl.com/4eqnlo&lt;/a&gt;    You will note that a few of the trajectories
 do indeed suggest a source in the Lake Baikal region of eastern Asia, 
 which is often an area of major fires and smoke in the Springtime...]]></description>
