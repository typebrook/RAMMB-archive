					<description><![CDATA[There are several other boundaries in the radar loop as well. One southwest to northeast of Hamilton and another from Russellville to the southwest. After talking with the radar operator from that day...if you look at the last frame, the showers west of Columbus eventually develop into the Hackelburg EF5 while the shower northwest of Tuscaloosa becomes the Cullman tornado. Both of which appear to be directly on or within the influence of the convective boundaries.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dan,  

Thank you for posting your comments and animations regarding this historic tornado outbreak over Alabama.  The mesoscale aspects of these systems are always so interesting, especially when gravity waves are involved.  

Have you seen the undular bore that move out over the western Gulf of Mexico that morning?  http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/goes/blog/archives/7905]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Jon - yes, I was referring to the gravity waves in this event up to early afternoon that did not result in CI, whereas the low-level convergence boundaries did.  Gravity waves can definitely play a role in CI, and may have even later in this case but it becomes difficult to discern later in the day as we get anvil cirrus.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice blog post, Dan!  

I did want to comment on one of your statements in the post.  You mentioned that: &quot;One way to discriminate between gravity waves and low-level convergence boundaries is that convection may develop along the convergence lines while convection does not develop along the gravity waves since they exist at a higher level.&quot;  Perhaps that was the case with this event, but I believe that gravity waves, whether jet or convective-induced can place a role in subsequent convective initiation.  I believe that the 3-4 April 1974 Super Outbreak had numerous gravity waves that may have led to tornadic supercell development.  I bet there are other cases, too.

Enjoy!
