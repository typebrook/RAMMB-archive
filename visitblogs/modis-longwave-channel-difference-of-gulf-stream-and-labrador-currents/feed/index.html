					<description><![CDATA[This is a very nice example that shows not only the striking differences in water temperatures off the Mid-Atlantic coast, but also the potential value of image differencing. 

An AWIPS image of the MODIS Sea Surface Temperature product:  http://tinyurl.com/ykav93d  showed a very large change in SST values over a very short distance (ranging from 73.9 F in the Gulf Stream to 48.5 F in the Labrador current). This also is a good example to highlight the value of satellite data for model verification -- the MODIS SST values showed that the RTG SST Hi-Res model SST fields: http://tinyurl.com/yaodv7y  were about 1-2 F too warm in the Gulf Stream, but as much as 10-14 F too warm within the tight SST gradient between the cold Labrador current and the Gulf Stream. 

As for the large change in sign over the Labrador current in Figure 7, that likely indicated an increase in low-level moisture, and the flow of unseasonably warm air off the Mid-Atlantic states was being cooled to near its dew point over the cold waters of the Labrador current. In fact, the GOES-12 fog/stratus product: http://tinyurl.com/yh84fxa  began to show a signal of fog/stratus over the colder waters shortly after sunset.]]></description>
