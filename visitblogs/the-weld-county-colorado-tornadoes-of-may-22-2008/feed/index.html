					<description><![CDATA[You are right about the west coast. We had a water spout a few weeks ago. I&#039;ve heard of it happening a few times, actually. It&#039;s nothing like NC though, where I grew up. There were some scary nights there, when you are told via emergency broadcast that there was a tornado warning for your county. Now, mind you, the county is 50 square miles, so who knew where it was or from which direction it was coming! Also, we didn&#039;t have a storm shelter. So you had to just sit and hope and pray! I&#039;ll live with the occational water spout for now..]]></description>
