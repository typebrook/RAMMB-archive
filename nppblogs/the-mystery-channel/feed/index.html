					<description><![CDATA[Just came across this as I was looking at the eye candy from GOES-R/16 that the rest of us finally have access to.  I&#039;m truly blown away!  2 km resolution, 15 min full disk and 5 min regional images in every band, all from GEO: whoa!  Seriously, this must be what it felt like decades ago when they saw the first weather satellite images.  It&#039;s like upgrading from a Yugo / Geo Metro to a Ferrari.  (Still don&#039;t know why Himawari&#039;s public interface isn&#039;t as nice as this, but oh well.)

Anyway, my question for this particular blog: did you ever figure out why this band (M8) is not present in any of the GEO birds?  I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s because snow is mostly a high latitude thing, but no idea otherwise.  You&#039;ve shown without question how useful it is.  Did you pose it to anyone since you wrote this?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Not exactly related to this post, but I&#039;m looking at fire detections for the thomas fire in california and the VIIRS-based detections show a lot of false-positives. For example, on dec 10th in montecito, CA and the days before there were a lot of detections in the middle of carpinteria when in fact those areas have not burned. What causes these false positives?]]></description>
