					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;./nppblogs/the-aurora-seen-around-the-world/#comment-126&quot;&gt;Peter Morse&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Peter - The VIIRS instrument shown here provides static images of the aurora. The animations are comprised of individual satellite overpasses separated in time by ~100 minutes. It is possible (although likely difficult) to extract the aurora signal from the data and plot that to any map projection you wish. And it is certainly possible to use alpha layers to provide transparency to combine this data with any underlying background you want. But, you will be limited by the fact that this satellite instrument does not provide animated images like a high-powered video camera would of an aurora.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Curtis - really fascinating work. I&#039;ve come across your work because I was searching for any data sources using equirectangular global projections of auroral data (preferably with alpha channels and no underlying vector map artwork) for some data visualisation software I&#039;ve been working on - perhaps the underlying data you&#039;ve used for these animations could be used (rather than a polar stereographic projection)? I understand these images are derived from different satellite passes, so are not temporally adjacent - is there anything around that images the South or North Pole&#039;s auroral data in a single image that might be animated? Thanks! Peter]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Rodney,

Thanks for the compliment!

These images were produced using our &quot;ERF-dynamic scaling&quot; algorithm, which is discussed more on our sister blog at the links below:

					<description><![CDATA[Curtis,

I was really impressed with your aurora images from VIIRS for the St Patricks day space weather storm.   I would love to explore the idea of a realtime aurora page.  We have a model that we use to forecast the aurora  at

http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/30-minute-aurora-forecast

Your data would be a fantastic addition to this site and could make an entire product by itself.

How much processing did you have to do to the VIIRS images.  I know there are issues with scattered light.

Cheers
Rodney]]></description>
