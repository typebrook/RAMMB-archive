					<description><![CDATA[India does have a serious pollution problem. Apart from the air pollution there are even other hazards which are not seriously dealt with. The waste water which is often times poisonous is left untreated into the seas by the large industries. This leads to marine life imbalance and also causes so many diseases to people living nearby to the sea.

The smog is quite a serious problem in India. The larger cities and the residents are prone to get lung diseases and other respiratory infections.

 I am grateful that I live in a small yet developed city where there is no smog problem. The morning mist is clean and smells great and refreshing.

Nice and informative post. Thanks.]]></description>
