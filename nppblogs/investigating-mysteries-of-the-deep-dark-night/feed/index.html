I saw these light last week at the exact spot North East of Japan and south of the Russian penninsula]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;./nppblogs/investigating-mysteries-of-the-deep-dark-night/#comment-118&quot;&gt;Xun Zhang&lt;/a&gt;.

You got it!

en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_saury. 

As Wiki say, these fish congregate in autumn in the middle of the Pacific and fishing boat use 500W light to attract saury. White on one side and red light on the other. Because of the &quot;..great economic importance..&quot; it explain the density of ships/lights. The green light would be the big freezer ship at the periphery of the pack.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am a Chinese student studying fisheries in Hokkaido University, Japan. You are right, they were not squid fishing boats, but actually, Japanese fishermen use red and orange light to catch saury over there, I am very sure about it. 
Just found your website, this mystery has last so long. Thank you very much for sharing so many things about VIIRS images, I learned a lot. Good job and keep it up!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Not an expert by any means, but there are indeed a number of rules related to ship lights used for navigation purposes (including red, green and orange/yellow).  

One of many examples:  http://www.gosailing.info/Navigation%20Lights.htm

Clouds do a fine job of scattering and diffusing these lights and can make their integrated effect far more prominent spatially than what would be seen from the point sources under clear skies.  The fact that several of the photos include strong night glow structures (awesome!) means that there was a significant sensitivity and exposure time to these photos, making these ship lights appear even more powerful.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the response!

I know I&#039;m pretty convinced those lights are from ships but, like you said, those are very bright red and orange lights that are very unusual to see. I haven&#039;t been able to find an explanation as to why ships would use those lights. I guess some things will have to remain a mystery!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you very much for this very interesting article about the sighting and the photos I took over the Pacific. Its a pity I never saw it before, since I have been looking for answers on what we saw that night ever since.

Looking at this data it sure does look like its a group of ships, though the reason that we quickly dismissed fishing ships was that they never use red lights. Red light does not penetrate the water more then a few feet because of its long wavelength, and fish cannot even see that kind of light.
Also, normally those fishing fleet with bright (green &#038; white) lights are fishing over the continental plate, or on the edge where the plate plunges into the abyss, since that&#039;s where the most fish are.

Military vessels often carry red lights at night for night vision, though the lights we saw here were so strong and bright, they would probably have blinded their own personnel too. 

Anyway, thanks a lot for your very thorough analysis, its more then appreciated.]]></description>
