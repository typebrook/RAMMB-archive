The ESA will need to set this up via a &#8216;login script&#8217; on one of your office&#8217;s local servers. An example of how this will look once activated is noted below (blue arrow pointing to our newly mapped &#8220;T-drive&#8221;).<\/p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-5656 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/rammb2.cira.colostate.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/ts1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"496\" height=\"435\" \/>\n<div align=\"left\">\n<p>3. The majority of your staff should be set up to have &#8220;read&#8221; access only to these files (Windows XP operating system). Limit the number of staff (SOO, Training FP, &#8230;) who will have &#8220;full&#8221; access to this drive for the purpose of setting up the recorded sessions.4. Place your recorded sessions in separate directories (such as in the example image under #2 above (orange arrow)).<\/p>\n<p>5.

Links to the <u><b>altered <\/b><\/u>&#8216;visitauto.bat&#8217; files will allow your staff to view these recorded sessions from any PC in the office. Below is an example of part of our web page whereby access to recorded training can be obtained. The &#8216;Start Training&#8217; buttons are where the links to the recorded training is defined.<\/p>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5654\" src=\"https:\/\/rammb2.cira.colostate.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/ts3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1127\" height=\"791\" \/>\n<p>Under this configuration, each workstation will be running &#8220;locally&#8221;, even though they are actually sharing the files.
